## 3. Features
[`Back To Top`](#table-of-contents)
The website consists of 3 responsive pages with 1 to 3 features per page.

Each page has 2 general layout shifts between handheld devices and desktop devices.

### Features at release
Header and footer sections are shared across all pages.

I've kept both relatively clean as the content of the pages themselves contain a lot of information, so it helps balance things out.

<details>
<summary> 1. Header</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-header.png">
</details>

The header consists of 2 sections. 

1. Logo - I was able to create a very simple and effective logo by combining the Maths theme (hence the squared) and the M from both Math and Masters.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Images</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-logo-small.png">
</details>

2. Nav Menu - A very clean design with some animations to make it smoother. In handheld devices the nav bar turns into a hamburger menu. The styling of both version is relatively similar.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Images</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-nav.png">
<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-nav-handhelds.png">
</details>


Footer contains the full logo of the company, social media links and buttons which control a modal. Just like the header has been kept minimalist, with all of the content being centered.

<details>
<summary> 2. Footer</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-footer.png">
</details>

1. Social Media Links  - Used Fontawesome's icons within an anchor element.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image</summary>

</details>

_User Story Covered - 10, 21_

2. Modal Buttons - An event listener attached to divs with a `role="button"`. Upon click brings a modal on top of the page content. There is only one modal being used by both buttons, so depending on which one is clicked the content is being changed in the background. The modal by default contain an error message, so in the event that only the event listener loads - we still have content to advise the user something has gone wrong.

#### index.html - Home Page 
Home page consists of 3 features. 

The home page is relatively busy, using various content to grab the user's attention. 

1. Carousel - Made up of tabs and slides with buttons. When a slide is active the appropriate slide is shown while the tab is raised and its color made opaque, while inactive slides are hidden and inactive tabs have their opacity reduced. The logic controlling the change of slide uses a `setInterval()` function set to trigger every 5 seconds (5000ms) and 'active' class styles. Each button takes the page to a different page on the website.

2. Methodology Section - Consists for 3 interactive sub-sections. When clicked each section blurs and darkens its background and shows text. When clicked again reverts to its original state.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image</summary>

</details>

_User Stories Covered - 5, 19_ 

3. Contact Us Section - Contains classes information section, a Google Maps `iframe`, and the academy's contact information and address.

    Each of the app icons navigates to the app's home page in a new tab.

    Google Maps has a pin and displays the address.

    Activating the phone number redirects to the mobile phone's dial pad, while the e-mail address gets passed to the operating system which opens the default mailing agent.

#### Quiz Page - quiz.html 

The quiz page contains only 1 feature, the quiz itself.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-quiz.png">
</details>

The first thing the user is greeted is by the instructions/details, an input field for the user's name and a disabled (for now) "Let's go!" button. In order to enable the button the user will need to input a minium of any 3 characters, however the name cannot contain spaces. After typing the name and pressing the start button, the modal disappears and the game starts. 

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-quiz-end-modal.png">
</details>

As the game starts, a timer is set to 30 seconds, the question is displayed and the answers are loaded. Each question has only one correct answer. 

The scoring of the game is based on picking correct answer, how many correct answers the user has answered, if the user is on a spree, and how long it takes for the user to answer. For every two correct answers the user hits a spree. Every time the user hits a spree the timer is reduced by 10 seconds, until it hits 10 seconds total, then further reduced down to 5; the multiplier is also increased by 1, up to a maximum of 10. The default points for answered questions is 10, which is multiplier by the multiplier value at the time of answering the question, for a maximum of `100` points The score is further increased by how short the timer is at the time of calculation and how much time left when the answer was clicked. If the timer maximum duration is 30, there is no additional multiplier, it returns 30 points. If the maximum duration is 20, the time left is multiplier by 3. If 10 - multiplied by 5. If 5 - multiplied by 100; for a total maximum of `500` points from the timer scoring. The maximum total score at the end of the game is `8760` points.

At the end of the game the modal re-appears with the results from the game.
