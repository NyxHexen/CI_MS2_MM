## 3. Features
[`Back To Top`](#table-of-contents)
The website consists of 3 responsive pages with 1 to 3 features per page.

Each page has 2 general layout shifts between handheld devices and desktop devices.

### Features at release
Header and footer sections are shared across all pages.

I've kept both relatively clean as the content of the pages themselves contain a lot of information, so it helps balance things out.

<details>
<summary> 1. Header</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-header.png">
</details>

The header consists of 2 sections. 

1. Logo - I was able to create a very simple and effective logo by combining the Maths theme (hence the squared) and the M from both Math and Masters.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Images</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-logo-small.png">
</details>

2. Nav Menu - A very clean design with some animations to make it smoother. In handheld devices the nav bar turns into a hamburger menu. The styling of both version is relatively similar.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Images</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-nav.png">
<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-nav-handhelds.png">
</details>

Footer contains the full logo of the company, social media links and buttons which control a modal. Just like the header has been kept minimalist, with all of the content being centered.

<details>
<summary> 2. Footer</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-footer.png">
</details>

1. Full Logo - Full version of the academy's logo.

_User Story Covered - 1_

2. Social Media Links  - Used Fontawesome's icons within an anchor element.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-footer-social-media.png">
</details>

_User Story Covered - 10, 21_

3. Modal Buttons - An event listener attached to divs with a `role="button"`. Upon click brings a modal on top of the page content. There is only one modal being used by both buttons, so depending on which one is clicked the content is being changed in the background. The modal by default contain an error message, so in the event that only the event listener loads - we still have content to advise the user something has gone wrong.

### index.html - Home Page 
Home page consists of 3 features. 

The home page is relatively busy, using various content to grab the user's attention. 

1. Carousel - Made up of tabs and slides with buttons. When a slide is active the appropriate slide is shown while the tab is raised and its color made opaque, while inactive slides are hidden and inactive tabs have their opacity reduced. The logic controlling the change of slide uses a `setInterval()` function set to trigger every 5 seconds (5000ms) and 'active' class styles. Each button takes the page to a different page on the website.

_User Stories Covered - 5, 19_ 

3. About Us Section - Contains classes information section, a Google Maps `iframe`, and the academy's contact information and address.

    Each of the app icons navigates to the app's home page in a new tab.

    Google Maps has a pin and displays the address.

    Activating the phone number redirects to the mobile phone's dial pad, while the e-mail address gets passed to the operating system which opens the default mailing agent.

### Quiz Page - quiz.html 

The quiz page contains only 1 feature, the quiz itself.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-quiz.png">
</details>

The first thing the user is greeted is by the instructions/details, an input field for the user's name and a disabled (for now) "Let's go!" button. In order to enable the button the user will need to input a minium of any 3 characters, however the name cannot contain spaces. After typing the name and pressing the start button, the modal disappears and the game starts. 

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image</summary>

<img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-quiz-end-modal.png">
</details>

As the game starts, a timer is set to 30 seconds, the question is displayed and the answers are loaded. Each question has only one correct answer. 

The scoring of the game is based on picking correct answer, how many correct answers the user has answered, if the user is on a spree, and how long it takes for the user to answer. For every two correct answers the user hits a spree. Every time the user hits a spree the timer is reduced by 10 seconds, until it hits 10 seconds total, then further reduced down to 5; the multiplier is also increased by 1, up to a maximum of 10. The default points for answered questions is 10, which is multiplied by the multiplier value at the time of answering the question, for a maximum of `100` points The score is further increased by how short the timer is at the time of calculation and how much time left when the answer was clicked. If the timer maximum duration is 30, there is no additional multiplier, it returns 30 points. If the maximum duration is 20, the time left is multiplied by 3. If 10 - multiplied by 12. If 5 - multiplied by 48; for a total maximum of `240` points from the timer scoring. 

At the end of the game the modal re-appears with the results from the game.

### Booking Page - booking.html 

Booking page is comprised of 3 features.

1. Marketing Section - consists of 4 parts.
- Image of a school classroom.
- Title, same as the name of the page on the Nav bar.
- Badge, alerting the users that the first two courses booked through the website are free.
- Text, inviting the users to book an online course.

This feature does not have any functionality, however as the rest of the website is fully responsive. It is purely used as a way to motivate the user to book classes with the academy.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image</summary>

_User Stories Covered - 1, 4, 17_

2. Booking Section - a highly interactive and reactive mock booking system containing 4 parts.
- School Level buttons, the trigger buttons of this feature. In order for the booking system to be initiated the user will first need to pick between Primary and Secondary school.
- School Year drop-down menu, step two of the booking process. Once the school level has been selected the contents of the drop-down menu changes according to the choice. 
    <details>
    <summary> Supporting Image</summary>

    <img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-booking-buttons.png">
    </details>
- Activity Cards - once the user has selected an option from the dropdown menu, if there are any cards available for the specific options they will be displayed. Alternatively, if no classes are available a special no-class card will be shown which contains an image and a title informing the user there are no classes available. The cards contain all the class information, including a picture and name of the tutor, and an "Add to Cart" button. When pressed the button changes text content and becomes disabled.
    <details>
    <summary> Supporting Image</summary>

    <img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-booking-activity-cards.png">
    <img src="docs/features/math-masters-academy-booking-no-class-card.png">
    </details>
- Booking Cart, containing the last two steps to complete before the booking is completed.
    1. The cart itself, step 1 of 2, fades in once the user has clicked on the "Add to Cart" button on the classes cards.
        - The item added to the cart has three areas of focus - a "remove from cart" X icon, the name of the class, and the price of the class.
            - Each added class is stored as a key within the `sessionStorage` of the browser. Each time the page is refreshed any keys stored until that moment are deleted.
            - When the X icon is clicked the the class it belongs to is removed from the cart and the button of the card is enabled and the text content reverts to the initial value. If a storage key exists it is also updated accordingly.
        - Below the cart itself is shown the total of the cart, with the amount being, as expected, updated each time a class is added or removed.
        - The "Book Now" button takes us to step 2 of the booking process. The button will not do anything if the cart is left empty. Once the button is clicked, all card buttons are changed to disabled to prevent accidental changes to the cart. At time of release this button does not show any errors to the user to signal that it is empty, but will be added in future.

    <details>

    </details>

    2. Once the user is happy with their selection they proceed to a form where they need to add their name and e-mail address, as it would be recorded in the system in order to finalize their order.
        - This form has additional name and e-mail validation to ensure that all fields are correctly completed.
        - Reset button, self-explanatory.
        - User also has the option to go back to their cart if they would like to add additional items.

    3. Once form is submitted the user is shown a booking confirmation and instructions to check their inbox where they will receive an e-mail confirming the classes and total amount due.
        - The user is also given the option to restart the booking process by clicking a button which refreshes the page.

## 6. Bug/Fix Log

| ID | Bug | Fix
|--- |--- |---
| 1 | Default form behavior allows for submit even when name and e-mail are incorrect | Added additional validation to forms by creating functions.
| 2 | Microsoft Teams icon now showing up when using % width and no height. | Added height property with rem value. 
| 3 | 404 error for 192x192 favicon image | Deleted old files and re-added favicon
| 4 | Multiplier not resetting on timer timeout and no answer selected | Ongoing.
| 5 | Newsletter form not sizing correctly from 900px width to 1200px | Adjusted width to 95% for 900+px.
| 6 | Carousel and Methodology event listeners throwing errors when page is not index.html | Added conditional statement to allow for the event listeners to be attached to elements only when page is '/', '/CI_MS2_MM/', or '/index.html'.
| 7 | WAVE shows contrast issue for Carousel slide titles as WAVE does not see backdrop created by `::before` pseudo-class | Added semi-transparent black background with backdrop blur to titles.
| 8 | Quiz start modal allows for three space characters as a valid name | Added additional name validation to input.
| 9 | Quiz answers can be clicked over and over again which ramps up points | Added conditional statement to button which does not allow the answer to be clicked more than once until next question is loaded.
| 10 | Class cards being generated with `aria-hidden` due to template having the property. | Added code to remove `aria-hidden` from each generated class card.
| 11 | SVG font breaks on Chrome Mobile and goes to fallback font. | Replaced SVG with webp image.
| 12 | `tickTock()` continues to run to next question timer causing new timer to tick twice or more as fast. | Added `stopTimer()` to tickTock when time left is 0 and to `selectAnswer()` function.
| 13 | `document.addEventListener('onload')` not working on index.js | Replaced with ternary operator expression; instead of reassigning the event onload handler we use `addEvent` to add to the windows's event handlers chain.
| 14 | `scoreTotal` variable returning NaN on Chrome Mobile | Wrapped calculation in template literals so the number is passed as a string.
| 15 | Answer animation flickering on load in and out | Added `transform:` to "unset" animation so it makes it a default value rather than a result of animation.
| 16 | `sessionStorage` does not clear on refresh | Added `onbeforeload` event to the page which scrubs the `sessionStorage` every time the page is opened.
| 17 | JavaScript Validator shows emailjs as undefined. | Ongoing.
| 18 | `startCarousel()` does not work if defined within conditional statement block scope | Moved function to global scope.
| 19 | Booking cart submits even if empty | Added validation to ensure cart does not submit if there are no classes added.
| 20 | Booking cart form "Back" button does not work as intended. When the booking cart is shown again through the "Back" button none of the event listeners work. | Changed the way each booking cart step is shown/hidden to ensure items are not deleted from the page.
| 21 | Form validation adds a new element when new error is thrown but does not delete previous error. | Added conditional statement to ensure that if an error exists already it is deleted first, before a new one is added.
